If you are creating a game without an audio budget, it does not mean it won't have sound. A game without sound does not make for a great mood.

Even if sound effects aren't your forte the what you can do is voice them yourself (which can be quite funny), look on [opengameart](http://opengameart.org/) or generate sounds using tools like [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/).
